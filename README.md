software engineer

i'm a software engineer who focus in building solutions to problems. my work spans frontend and backend technologies, using typescript, react, python to solve problems.

the github showcases my projects and experiments. each repository represents a challenge solved or a new skill learned. i'm always looking to create something meaningful and improve my craft.

interested in collaboration or just want to talk? feel free to reach out or email.
